# TestSuites
This project is a simple description of what can do **Jasmine** and **Mocha-Chai** test suites.
They are almost the same, but Chai is a bit more verbose, but it's really a "speaking language".

The starting point for both suites is `index.html`, it loads a mockup file called `test.json` and runs tests written in `jasmineTest.js` and in `mochaTest.js`. The output will be displayed straight to the browser window.
